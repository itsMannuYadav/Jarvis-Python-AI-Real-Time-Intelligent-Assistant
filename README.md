## Overview
Jarvis is a powerful, real-time, intelligent assistant built with Python. It combines advanced AI models, real-time search, automation, and a modern GUI to help you with daily tasks, answer questions, generate images, and much moreâ€”all in one place.

## Features
- **Conversational AI**: Chat with Jarvis using natural language, powered by Cohere and Groq LLMs.
- **Real-Time Search**: Get up-to-date information from Google, YouTube, and the web.
- **Automation**: Open/close apps, set reminders, play music, and more.
- **Image Generation**: Create images from text prompts using AI.
- **Speech Recognition & Synthesis**: Talk to Jarvis and get spoken responses.
- **Modern GUI**: User-friendly interface built with PyQt5.
- **Persistent Chat Logs**: All conversations are saved for future reference.
- **Secure API Key Management**: Uses a `.env` file for sensitive keys (never committed to the repo).

## Usage
- **Start Jarvis**: Run `python Main.py` and interact via the GUI or terminal.
- **Chat**: Ask questions, get real-time info, or automate tasks.
- **Image Generation**: Use prompts like "generate image of a cat".
- **Automation**: Try commands like "open notepad", "set a reminder at 9pm".

## Environment Variables
Sensitive information is stored in a `.env` file (not tracked by git). See `.env.example` for required variables:
- `CohereAPIKey`
- `GroqAPIKey`
- `Username`
- `Assistantname`

---

## Security
- **Never share your real `.env` file.**
- API keys are required for full functionality. If you lose your `.env`, generate new keys from the provider dashboards.
